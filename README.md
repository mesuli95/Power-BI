  # Introduction to Power BI

  * Microsoft Power BI is a complete reporting solution that offers data preparation, data visualization, distribution, and management through development tools and an online platform.
  * Use Power BI to create visually stunning, interactive reports to serve as the analytics and decision engine behind group projects, divisions, or entire organizations.
  * Power BI is an essential tool to data analysts and their organization; however, all data professionals benefit from understanding how Power BI works to explore and present data insights within organizations.

# There are three primary components to Power BI:

* Power BI Desktop (desktop application)
* Power BI service (online platform)
* Power BI Mobile (cross-platform mobile app)

* Power BI Desktop is the development tool available to data analysts and other report creators.
* While the Power BI service allows you to organize, manage, and distribute your reports and other Power BI items.
* Power BI Desktop is available to download for free either through the Windows store or directly online.

# The flow of Power BI is:

1. Connect to data with Power BI Desktop.
2. Transform and model data with Power BI Desktop.
3. Create visualizations and reports with Power BI Desktop.
4. Publish report to Power BI service.
5. Distribute and manage reports in the Power BI service.

* The Power BI service also allows you to create high-level dashboards that drill down to reports, and apps to easily group related reports to users in a simple format.

# Building blocks of Power BI

* The building blocks of Power BI are semantic models and visualizations.
* Create a semantic model and then use visuals to build a report. Let's explore these items in more detail and how they relate to the flow of Power BI.

# Create a semantic model

* A semantic model consists of all connected data, transformations, relationships, and calculations.
* To follow the flow of Power BI, you first connect to data, transform data, and create relationships and calculations to create a semantic model.
* First, connect to as many data sources you need.
* Then clean and transform the data to your needs. Add relationships between tables and calculations to extend the semantic model.

# Create visualizations in a report

* In Power BI Desktop, when you create a visualization (also called visual), you add it to the canvas for a report page.
* Power BI is a low-code solution, which means that you can "drag and drop" data field directly onto the canvas.
* Power BI will choose a visual for your data field.
* You can easily change between visuals for the same fields, and add or remove data fields to the visual.
* One of the most valuable features of Power BI reports is the interactivity between visuals.
* Consumers can select different data points in the visual and see how that affects the other visuals.
* Depending on your design, they can also drillthrough from one visual to more detail or filter based on different fields in the report.

# Create a dashboard

* In the Power BI service, you can also create dashboards after you've published a report.
* Dashboards consist of a single page made up of tiles.
* Add tiles to a dashboard by pinning a visual in a report to the dashboard.
* Dashboards are an excellent way to provide high-level information to consumers.
